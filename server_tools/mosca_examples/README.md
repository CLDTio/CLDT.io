# Mosca Examples
A couple of simple examples on how to use [Mosca](https://github.com/mcollina/mosca) as an MQTT broker. Note that the example uses MongoDB as a backend for the pub/sub service.

## Usage
 - Install MongoDB
 - Install mosca and mqtt with npm
 - Run `node server.js` and then `node client.js`

Done!
